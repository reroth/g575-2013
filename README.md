Code + Tutorials for the UW-Madison G575 Course (2013)

This repository includes the lab assignment source and instructions for the University of Wisconsin-Madison Geography 575 (Interactive Cartography & Geovisualization) course: http://www.geography.wisc.edu/courses/geog575/. 

Labs #1 and #2 make use of the open source Leaflet, jQuery, and jQueryUI libraries. Lab #3 makes use of the D3 library, the Shape Escape web service, and the TopoJSON format. The labs are written for a senior undergraduate / graduate student level and assume one introductory computer science prerequisite (not in JavaScript).
